Perfect! I've created the **Planner Agent Implementation Prompt** with framework guidance only - no actual code implementation.

## What I've Delivered

### 1. [AGENT_FRAMEWORK.md](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/AGENT_FRAMEWORK.md)
Complete architecture document showing:
- All 11 agents and their relationships
- Dependency graph
- Data flow patterns
- Caching strategy
- Performance targets

### 2. [PROMPT_01_PLANNER_AGENT.md](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/PROMPT_01_PLANNER_AGENT.md)
Comprehensive implementation guide for the Planner Agent including:
- **14 sections** covering every aspect of building the agent
- Intent classification strategy (9 intent types)
- Tool registration with detailed schemas for all 9 downstream agents
- System prompt design with execution patterns (A, B, C, D)
- Helper functions framework (5 key helpers)
- Integration guardrails and contracts
- Testing strategy with specific test cases
- Performance considerations (timeouts, caching, parallelization)
- 3 detailed conversation flow examples
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Success criteria checklist

## Key Highlights

The prompt ensures **integration guardrails** between agents:
- Standardized tool schemas all agents must follow
- Output contracts the Planner must always return
- Error propagation rules
- Request ID tracing through the entire chain

It explains **when and how** to call each agent:
- Pattern A: Simple proximity → retrieve + enrich + rank
- Pattern B: NL search → retrieve + interpret + enrich + rank  
- Pattern C: Allergen-focused → retrieve + interpret + find_menu + analyze + rank + qa
- Pattern D: Detail view → eager enrichment with parallel execution

## Next Steps

Would you like me to create the implementation prompt for the **Data Enrichment Agent** next? This is the 11th agent you mentioned - it enriches the basic OSM data from `restaurant_retrieval.py` with ratings, reviews, contact info, and menu URLs using web search.
